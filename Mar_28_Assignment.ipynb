    "Ridge regression is a type of **linear regression** that is used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is similar to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but with an additional **penalty term** that is added to the sum of squared residuals. This penalty term is used to **shrink the coefficients** of the independent variables towards zero, which helps to reduce the variance of the estimates and improve the model's generalization performance ¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge regression and OLS regression is that Ridge regression adds a **regularization term** to the loss function, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients. In contrast, OLS regression does not include any regularization term and can lead to overfitting when there are many independent variables in the model ¹³."

    "Ridge Regression is an extension of linear regression, and like linear regression, it makes several key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means that changes in the independent variables are associated with constant changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: It is assumed that the errors (residuals), which are the differences between the observed and predicted values, are independent of each other. In other words, the error for one observation should not depend on the errors for other observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors): Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same throughout the range of predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Errors: The errors are assumed to be normally distributed. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "No or Little Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. When multicollinearity is present (high correlation between independent variables), it can be challenging to separate their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while Ridge Regression shares these assumptions with linear regression, it is somewhat more robust to violations of the multicollinearity assumption due to its regularization process, which can help in dealing with correlated independent variables."

The model is then trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on the remaining subset. This process is repeated multiple times, with different subsets used for training and evaluation each time. The value of lambda that results in the best performance on average across all folds is selected ².\n",
