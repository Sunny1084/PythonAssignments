    "Reduced Dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding reduces the dimensionality of the dataset compared to one-hot encoding. If you have a large number of unique categories within a feature, one-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of columns (curse of dimensionality). Nominal encoding keeps the data in a single column, which can be advantageous when working with high-dimensional data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is memory-efficient compared to one-hot encoding. Storing binary values (0 or 1) for one-hot encoded columns can consume more memory, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",

    "Scenario: Customer Satisfaction Levels\n",
    "Suppose you're analyzing customer feedback data, and one of the features is \"Satisfaction Level,\" which has categories like \"Very Unsatisfied,\" \"Unsatisfied,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Satisfied,\" and \"Very Satisfied.\" These categories have a clear order from least to most satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use one-hot encoding for this feature, you would create four binary columns, which can be computationally expensive and may not be necessary. Instead, you can use nominal encoding and assign integer labels like this:\n",

    "Unsatisfied: 2\n",
    "Neutral: 3\n",

If the ordinal relationship doesn't exist, using one-hot encoding or other techniques may be more appropriate to avoid introducing unintended patterns into the data."

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can implement these encoding techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 3: Decide on the Encoding Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: If there is an ordinal relationship in the \"contract type\" column (e.g., month-to-month < one year < two years), you might consider label encoding this column. Gender, however, doesn't have a meaningful ordinal relationship, so it's better suited for one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding: For the \"gender\" column and any other nominal categorical columns (those without a meaningful order), one-hot encoding is a good choice. In this encoding, each category becomes a binary column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Implement Label Encoding (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"contract type\" column, you can use label encoding. Here's how to do it in Python using the LabelEncoder from scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an instance of LabelEncoder\n",
    "label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply label encoding to the 'contract type' column\n",
    "data['contract type'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['contract type'])\n",
    "Step 5: Implement One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"gender\" column and any other nominal categorical columns, you can use one-hot encoding. Here's how to do it in Python using the pd.get_dummies function from the Pandas library:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "Apply one-hot encoding to the 'gender' column\n",
    "data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['gender'], prefix=['gender'], drop_first=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply one-hot encoding to any other nominal categorical columns if present\n",
    "data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['other_nominal_column'], prefix=['prefix_for_column'], drop_first=True)\n",
    "In this code, pd.get_dummies creates binary (0 or 1) columns for each category in the specified column(s) while dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Finalize Your Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying the encoding techniques, you'll have a dataset with numerical representations of your categorical features. You can then use this dataset to build and train machine learning models for predicting customer churn.\n",
