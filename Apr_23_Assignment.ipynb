    "The **curse of dimensionality** is a common problem in machine learning, where the performance of the model deteriorates as the number of features increases ¹². This is because the complexity of the model increases with the number of features, and it becomes more difficult to find a good solution. In addition, high-dimensional data can also lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data ¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality reduction** is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible ¹. It can help to mitigate these problems by reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance ¹. There are two main approaches to dimensionality reduction: **feature selection** and **feature extraction** ¹. Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the problem at hand. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important features. There are several methods for feature selection, including filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Filter methods rank the features based on their relevance to the target variable, wrapper methods use the model performance as the criteria for selecting features, and embedded methods combine feature selection with the model training process. Feature extraction involves creating new features by combining or transforming the original features ¹.\n",

    "The **Curse of Dimensionality** is a term used to describe the difficulties that arise when working with high-dimensional data in machine learning ¹. It refers to a set of problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data, where the dimension of a dataset corresponds to the number of attributes/features that exist in a dataset ¹. A dataset with a large number of attributes, generally of the order of a hundred or more, is referred to as high dimensional data ¹. \n",

    "The curse of dimensionality can impact the performance of machine learning algorithms in several ways. One of the most significant impacts is that it can lead to **overfitting** ⁴. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization performance on new data ⁴. In high-dimensional spaces, the number of possible configurations grows exponentially with the dimensionality, making it difficult for machine learning algorithms to find patterns and make accurate predictions ¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another impact of the curse of dimensionality is that it can lead to **data sparsity** ¹. As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data required to maintain the same level of performance increases exponentially ¹. This can result in sparse data sets where there are few examples per feature combination, making it difficult for machine learning algorithms to learn meaningful patterns ⁴.\n",
