    "Density-Based Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Algorithms like DBSCAN and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) focus on identifying regions of lower data density. Data points \n",
    "that are in sparse or isolated regions are considered anomalies.\n",
    "Use Case: It's effective when anomalies are defined as data points that occur in regions of lower density compared to the \n",
    "majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Autoencoders are neural networks designed to reconstruct input data. During training, they learn to represent normal \n",
    "data accurately. Anomalies are detected when the reconstruction error is significantly high.\n",
    "Use Case: Autoencoders are suitable when anomalies can be defined as data points that deviate from the norm in terms of their \n",
    "features or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining the most critical information. Anomalies can be \n",
    "detected by identifying data points with large reconstruction errors when projected back into the original feature space.\n",
    "Use Case: PCA-based anomaly detection is suitable when anomalies manifest as deviations along principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: The Isolation Forest algorithm works by isolating anomalies more quickly in the data's hierarchical structure. It \n",
    "identifies anomalies as data points that require fewer splits to be isolated from the rest.\n",
    "Use Case: Isolation Forest is effective for detecting anomalies that are significantly different from the majority of data \n",
    "points.\n",

    "One-Class SVM:\n",

    "Method: One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) aim to find a hyperplane that separates the majority of data points from a \n",
    "region that contains anomalies. Data points lying in the outlier region are considered anomalies.\n",
    "Use Case: One-Class SVMs work well when anomalies are expected to be rare and can be defined as data points lying far from the \n",
    "center of the normal data distribution.\n",
