    "Ans In Python, multithreading refers to the technique of executing multiple threads (smaller units of a process) simultaneously\n",

    "performance and efficiency of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multithreading is used for several purposes such as parallel processing, input/output operations, and network \n",
    "operations. For example, a web server can use multithreading to handle multiple client requests simultaneously without waiting \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute simultaneously, leading to faster and more efficient \n",

    "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive to user input, even if some of the threads are busy \n",
    "executing other tasks.\n",
    "3. Resource sharing: Threads can share resources, such as memory and files, leading to more efficient use of system resources.\n",
    "4. Modularity: Multithreading can help to modularize complex programs, making them easier to understand, maintain, and update.\n",
    "5. Parallelism: Multithreading can enable parallelism, which allows multiple independent tasks to execute at the same time, \n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to programming, particularly when coordinating the execution of multiple \n",

    "2. Deadlocks: Multithreading can lead to deadlocks, where threads are waiting for resources that are held by other threads, \n",
    "leading to a system freeze.\n",
    "3. Race conditions: Multithreading can also lead to race conditions, where the behavior of a program depends on the order \n",
    "in which threads execute, leading to unpredictable results.\n",
    "4. Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging, particularly when trying to reproduce and diagnose \n",
    "issues that occur only in certain thread interleavings.\n",
    "5. Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead, such as the cost of context switching and thread synchronization, \n",
