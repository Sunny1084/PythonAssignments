    "1. **Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI)**: This measure evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, taking into account the size of each cluster ¹. A lower DBI score indicates better clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Silhouette Coefficient**: This measure evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters ². It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of +1 indicates that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters, and a value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters. Negative values indicate that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",

    "3. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: This measure evaluates the ratio of the between-cluster variance to the within-cluster variance ³. A higher CH score indicates better clustering.\n",

    "Accuracy is a commonly used evaluation metric for classification tasks, but it has some limitations. One of the main limitations of accuracy is that it does not take into account the class distribution of the data ¹. In other words, if the data is imbalanced, where one class has significantly more samples than the other, then accuracy can be misleading. For example, if a model predicts the majority class for all samples in an imbalanced dataset, it can achieve a high accuracy score even though it is not performing well ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, we can use other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) ². Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive samples. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC-ROC measures the ability of a model to distinguish between positive and negative samples ². These metrics are more suitable for imbalanced datasets and provide a more accurate assessment of a model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of accuracy is that it does not take into account the cost associated with different types of errors ³. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, a false negative (i.e., predicting that a patient does not have a disease when they actually do) can be more costly than a false positive (i.e., predicting that a patient has a disease when they actually do not). In such cases, we can use cost-sensitive evaluation metrics that take into account the cost associated with different types of errors ³.\n",

    "In summary, while accuracy is a useful evaluation metric for classification tasks, it has some limitations. To obtain a more accurate assessment of a model's performance, we can use other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC that are more suitable for imbalanced datasets and take into account the cost associated with different types of errors."
