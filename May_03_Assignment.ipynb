    "Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features from the original feature set to improve the performance of the anomaly detection model . The role of feature selection in anomaly detection is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and remove irrelevant or redundant features that may negatively impact the performance of the model . \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection can help in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved accuracy**: By removing irrelevant or redundant features, feature selection can improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection model .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced computational complexity**: Feature selection can reduce the computational complexity of the model by reducing the number of features that need to be processed .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved interpretability**: Feature selection can improve the interpretability of the model by reducing the number of features that need to be analyzed .\n",

The choice of feature selection technique depends on various factors such as data type, data size, and domain knowledge ."

A **border point** is a point that is not a core point but lies within the `epsilon` radius of a core point. All other points are considered **noise points**.\n",
