    "Hierarchical clustering is an **unsupervised clustering technique** that involves creating clusters in a predefined order. The clusters are ordered in a top-to-bottom manner, and similar clusters are grouped together and arranged in a hierarchical manner. Hierarchical clustering can be further divided into two types: **agglomerative hierarchical clustering** and **divisive hierarchical clustering** ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a **bottom-up approach** where each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. Divisive hierarchical clustering is a **top-down approach** where all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy ³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering has several advantages over other clustering methods, including the ability to handle non-convex clusters and clusters of different sizes and densities, the ability to handle missing data and noisy data, and the ability to reveal the underlying structure of your data ³⁴. \n",

    "Non-hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, involves formation of new clusters by merging or splitting the clusters. It does not follow a tree-like structure like hierarchical clustering. This technique groups the data to maximize or minimize some evaluation criteria. K-means clustering is an effective way of non-hierarchical clustering ¹.\n",
