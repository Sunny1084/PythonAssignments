The sub-sample size is controlled with the `max_samples` parameter¹. Random Forest Regressor can be used to solve both **regression** and **classification** tasks³.\n",

    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms¹. Here are a few ways it achieves this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Subspace Method**: Random Forest Regressor randomly selects a subset of features from the dataset to build each decision tree¹. This helps to reduce the correlation between trees and prevents them from relying too heavily on a single feature, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)**: Random Forest Regressor uses a technique called bagging, which involves training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data¹. By averaging the predictions of these trees, Random Forest Regressor reduces the variance and helps to generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Max Features**: The `max_features` parameter in Random Forest Regressor controls the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split at each node¹. By limiting the number of features, it reduces the complexity of individual trees and prevents them from becoming too specialized to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Averaging**: Random Forest Regressor combines the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging them¹. This ensemble averaging helps to smooth out individual tree predictions and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mechanisms work together to create an ensemble of decision trees that collectively make more robust predictions and are less prone to overfitting."

    "\n",
    "3. **Averaging**: The ensemble averaging helps to reduce the variance and improve the overall predictive accuracy of Random Forest Regressor¹. By combining the predictions from multiple trees, it can capture a wider range of patterns and make more robust predictions.\n",

    "**Random Forest Regressor** and **Decision Tree Regressor** are both supervised learning algorithms used for regression tasks, but they differ in several ways¹²³⁴. Here are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensemble vs. Single Model**: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions¹. In contrast, Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree to make predictions¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prediction Method**: Random Forest Regressor predicts the target variable by averaging the predictions of all the individual decision trees in the ensemble¹. Decision Tree Regressor predicts the target variable based on the rules learned from a single decision tree¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting**: Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor¹. This is because Random Forest Regressor uses techniques like random subspace method, bootstrap aggregation, and ensemble averaging to reduce overfitting¹. Decision Tree Regressor, on the other hand, can easily overfit the training data if not properly regularized¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Random Forest Regressor strikes a balance between bias and variance by combining predictions from multiple decision trees¹. Decision Tree Regressor tends to have low bias but high variance, which means it can capture complex patterns in the training data but may not generalize well to unseen data¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretability**: Decision Tree Regressor is more interpretable than Random Forest Regressor because it can be visualized as a tree diagram¹. Random Forest Regressor, being an ensemble of decision trees, does not have a single interpretable model representation¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor. The choice between the two depends on factors such as dataset size, complexity, interpretability requirements, and desired predictive performance."
