    "Time-dependent seasonal components are a type of seasonal component in time series analysis that vary over time. In other words, the seasonal pattern changes over time, and the amplitude and/or phase of the seasonal component is a function of time. For example, the seasonal pattern of sales of winter clothing may change over time due to changes in fashion trends or climate change. The presence of time-dependent seasonal components can make it difficult to model and forecast a time series. One approach to dealing with this issue is to use a dynamic regression model that includes a time-varying seasonal component."

One approach is to use a **seasonal decomposition** technique, which decomposes a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components ¹. The seasonal component can then be analyzed to determine if it is time-dependent. Another approach is to use a **dynamic regression model** that includes a time-varying seasonal component ¹. This model can capture the changes in the seasonal pattern over time and provide more accurate forecasts. \n",

    "To identify the presence of seasonality in a time series, one can use the **autocorrelation function (ACF)** or **partial autocorrelation function (PACF)** ¹. If there is a significant spike at the lag corresponding to the seasonal period, then there is evidence of seasonality. However, this method may not be effective for identifying time-dependent seasonality ¹. \n",
