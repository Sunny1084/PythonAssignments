    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a statistical hybrid method that combines two popular regularized linear regression techniques, **ridge** and **lasso**, to deal with multicollinearity issues when they arise between predictor variables². It is designed to overcome the limitations of the individual methods and provide a balance between them².\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, both the **L1 penalty** (used in lasso) and the **L2 penalty** (used in ridge) are employed simultaneously¹. This allows Elastic Net to benefit from the strengths of both methods. The L1 penalty encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection¹. On the other hand, the L2 penalty shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set them to absolute zero¹. This means that all features are retained in the model, although their importance may be reduced¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these penalties, Elastic Net can handle multicollinearity issues and select relevant features while maintaining a balance between model complexity and interpretability². It is particularly useful when there are many correlated predictors in the dataset²."

    "Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for **Elastic Net Regression** is an important task. Here are a few approaches to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: One common approach is to use cross-validation to estimate the performance of the model for different values of the regularization parameters¹. By splitting the data into training and validation sets, you can evaluate the model's performance using different combinations of the regularization parameters¹. The combination that results in the best performance on the validation set can be considered as the optimal choice¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Criteria**: Another approach is to use information criteria such as **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** or **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**⁴. These criteria provide a measure of model fit and complexity, allowing you to balance between goodness-of-fit and model simplicity⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grid Search**: You can also perform a grid search over a range of values for each regularization parameter and evaluate the model's performance for each combination¹. This allows you to systematically explore different combinations of the regularization parameters and select the one that yields the best results¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the optimal values of the regularization parameters may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset². It's often recommended to consult domain experts or seek guidance from experienced practitioners when choosing the optimal values. \n"
