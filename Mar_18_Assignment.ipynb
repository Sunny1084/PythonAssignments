    "The filter method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the relevance of each input variable to the target variable using statistical measures. It does not depend on any machine learning algorithm, and it selects a subset of features that have the highest scores based on the chosen measure. Some examples of statistical measures used in filter methods are information gain, chi-square test, correlation coefficient, and variance threshold. The filter method is fast and scalable, but it may ignore the interactions between features or the effect of the chosen model."

    "The wrapper method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the performance of a specific machine learning algorithm on different subsets of features and selects the best subset based on the chosen evaluation criterion. It uses a greedy search approach to find the optimal combination of features, such as forward selection, backward elimination, bi-directional elimination, or genetic algorithm. The wrapper method is more computationally expensive and prone to overfitting than the filter method, but it may give better results as it considers the interactions between features and the effect of the chosen model."

This can reduce the complexity and improve the accuracy of the model by eliminating irrelevant features.\n",

This can be calculated by various methods, such as Gini index, entropy, or permutation importance2. This can help identify and select the most influential features for the model.\n",

This can create a hierarchical structure of features that reflects their importance and relevance for the model."
