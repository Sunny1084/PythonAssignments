    "**Lasso Regression** is a type of **linear regression** that is used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is similar to other regression techniques such as **ordinary least squares (OLS)** regression and **Ridge regression**, but with an additional penalty term that is added to the sum of squared residuals ¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Lasso Regression is to find a balance between model simplicity and accuracy. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression model, which encourages sparse solutions where some coefficients are forced to be exactly zero. This feature makes Lasso particularly useful for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques such as OLS regression and Ridge regression is that Lasso Regression adds an **L1 regularization term** to the loss function, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients. In contrast, OLS regression does not include any regularization term and can lead to overfitting when there are many independent variables in the model. Ridge regression, on the other hand, adds an **L2 regularization term** to the loss function, which also helps to prevent overfitting but does not force any coefficients to be exactly zero ¹²."

    "Automated feature selection based on standard linear regression by stepwise selection or choosing features with the lowest p-values has many drawbacks. Lasso Regression provides a principled way to reduce the number of features in a model ¹. It involves a penalty factor that determines how many features are retained, and using cross-validation to choose the penalty factor helps ensure that the model will generalize well to future data samples ¹.\n",

    "In **Lasso Regression**, the tuning parameter is known as **alpha**¹. It controls the regularization strength and multiplies the L1 term¹. By adjusting the value of alpha, you can control the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients¹. Higher values of alpha result in more coefficients being set to zero, which means that more features are excluded from the model¹. This can help with feature selection and reduce overfitting¹. On the other hand, lower values of alpha allow more coefficients to be non-zero, which means that more features are included in the model¹. This can lead to a more complex model with potentially better predictive performance but also a higher risk of overfitting¹.\n",

By introducing non-linear terms or basis functions, you can capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable¹.\n",
