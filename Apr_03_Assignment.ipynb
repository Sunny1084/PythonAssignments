    "Precision and recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, especially in situations where imbalanced classes or different costs for false positives and false negatives are involved. These metrics provide insights into how well a model is performing, particularly for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision:**\n",
    "   - Precision, also known as positive predictive value, measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by a model. It answers the question, \"Of all the instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\"\n",
    "   - Precision is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\\text{True Positives (TP)} + \\text{False Positives (FP)}} \\]\n",
    "   - High precision indicates that when the model predicts a positive class, it is usually correct. It minimizes false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):**\n",
    "   - Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the ability of a model to capture all the positive instances. It answers the question, \"Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?\"\n",
    "   - Recall is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\\text{True Positives (TP)} + \\text{False Negatives (FN)}} \\]\n",
    "   - High recall indicates that the model is good at identifying positive cases and minimizing false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two metrics often have a trade-off: as you increase precision, recall may decrease, and vice versa. This trade-off can be visualized using the precision-recall curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision:** Use precision when minimizing false positives is crucial. For example, in email spam detection, you want to avoid marking legitimate emails as spam (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall:** Use recall when capturing as many positive cases as possible is a priority. For example, in medical diagnoses, you want to ensure that all patients with a disease are correctly identified, even if it means some healthy individuals are mistakenly identified as positive (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, precision and recall are essential for evaluating classification models, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. It's common to use these metrics together to get a comprehensive view of a model's performance."

    "6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your trained model on the validation set using suitable evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. This step helps you assess how well your model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
