    "More Data: Increasing the size of your training dataset can help the model generalize better. More data provides a broader \n",

    "Use linear models (e.g., Linear Regression) instead of complex ones (e.g., Deep Neural Networks).\n",
    "Limit the depth of decision trees or random forests.\n",
    "Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features while discarding irrelevant or noisy ones. Feature \n",
    "engineering and domain knowledge can help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Apply regularization techniques to penalize large parameter values. Common types of regularization include:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): Encourages some model parameters to be exactly zero, effectively selecting a subset of features.\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge): Encourages small values for all model parameters, reducing their impact on predictions.\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess your model's generalization performance. Cross-validation helps identify overfitting by evaluating the model on multiple subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training. Stop training when the validation \n",

    "Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of models. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and making it perform poorly on unseen data.

Here are some common regularization techniques and how they work:\n",

    "L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. It encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's coefficients. It discourages large coefficient values.\n",
    "Use cases: L2 regularization is commonly used to prevent multicollinearity (correlation between predictor variables) in linear regression. It smoothens the model by spreading the impact of correlated features.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding both penalty terms to the loss function. It provides a balance between feature selection (L1) and coefficient shrinkage (L2).\n",
    "Use cases: Elastic Net is useful when you want to handle multicollinearity while performing feature selection.\n",
    "Dropout (Neural Networks):\n",

    "How it works: Dropout is a technique used in neural networks. During training, it randomly drops (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons in each layer, preventing the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons. During inference, all neurons are used.\n",
