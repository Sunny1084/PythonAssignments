This assumption can be checked by creating a scatter plot of the dependent variable against each independent variable. If the points in the plot form a roughly straight line, then this assumption is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The residuals (the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) should be independent of each other. This means that there should be no correlation between consecutive residuals in time series data. This assumption can be checked by creating a residual plot, which is a plot of the residuals against the predicted values. If there is no pattern in the residual plot, then this assumption is met.\n",

This assumption can be checked by creating a residual plot, which is a plot of the residuals against the predicted values. If there is no pattern in the residual plot, then this assumption is met.\n",

This assumption can be checked by creating a histogram or a normal probability plot of the residuals. If the histogram or normal probability plot shows a roughly symmetric and bell-shaped distribution, then this assumption is met.\n",

If these plots show that the assumptions are not met, then we may need to transform the data or use a different type of regression analysis."

Correlation analysis involves computing the correlation coefficient between each pair of independent variables. If the correlation coefficient is high (e.g., greater than 0.7), then there may be multicollinearity present. VIF is a measure of how much the variance of the estimated regression coefficients is increased due to multicollinearity in the model. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 indicates that there may be multicollinearity present.\n",
