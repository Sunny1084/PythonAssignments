    "Linear regression identifies the equation that produces the smallest difference between all the observed values and their fitted values. To be precise, linear regression finds the smallest sum of squared residuals that is possible for the dataset.

Unbiased in this context means that the fitted values are not systematically too high or too low anywhere in the observation space ¹.\n",

It is also called the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. For a given data set, higher R-squared values represent smaller differences between the observed data and the fitted values ¹. R-squared is always between 0 and 100%: 0% represents a model that does not explain any of the variation in the response variable around its mean. The mean of the dependent variable predicts the dependent variable as well as the regression model. 100% represents a model that explains all the variation in the response variable around its mean ¹. \n",
