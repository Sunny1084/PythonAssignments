    "assumptions need to be met. Violations of these assumptions can impact the validity of the ANOVA results. Here are the key \n",
    "assumptions for ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Observations: The observations within each group should be independent of each other. This means that the data \n",
    "points in one group should not be influenced by or related to the data points in other groups. Violation of this assumption can \n",
    "lead to inflated Type I error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If multiple measurements are taken from the same subject or if there is any form of clustering or \n",
    "dependence between observations in different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals (the differences between observed values and group means) should follow a normal distribution. While \n",
    "this assumption is more critical for small sample sizes, ANOVA is known to be robust to mild departures from normality when the \n",
    "sample size is sufficiently large (e.g., Central Limit Theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If the residuals are skewed or have heavy tails, indicating a departure from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneity of Variance (Homoscedasticity): The variance of the residuals should be approximately equal across all groups. This \n",
    "assumption is crucial because ANOVA assumes that the populations from which the samples are drawn have the same variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If some groups have much larger variances than others, it can lead to inaccurate p-values and decreased \n",
    "power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality of Group Sizes: Ideally, the sample sizes for each group should be equal, or at least, not substantially different. \n",
    "Unequal sample sizes can affect the power of the ANOVA test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If one group has a much larger sample size than the others, it may dominate the analysis, leading to \n",
    "biased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling: The data should be obtained through random sampling or an appropriate experimental design. This ensures that \n",
    "the sample is representative of the population from which it is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If the sample is not random and is, for instance, subject to selection bias, the results may not be \n",
    "generalizable to the broader population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This assumption means that the error for one\n",
    "observation should not be related to the error for any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of violation: If there is a temporal or spatial autocorrelation between errors in time series or spatial data, this \n",
