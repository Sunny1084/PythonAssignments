    "**GridSearchCV** is a technique used in machine learning for **hyperparameter tuning**. The purpose of GridSearchCV is to determine the optimal values for the hyperparameters of a given model¹. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before training the model. They control the behavior and performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of GridSearchCV involves trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values and evaluating the model's performance for each combination using **cross-validation**¹. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by splitting the available data into multiple subsets or folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how GridSearchCV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You define a **grid** of hyperparameter values that you want to search over. This grid can be defined as a dictionary, where each key represents a hyperparameter, and the corresponding value is a list of possible values for that hyperparameter¹.\n",
    "2. GridSearchCV then performs an **exhaustive search** over all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the grid.\n",
    "3. For each combination, GridSearchCV trains and evaluates the model using cross-validation. The performance metric used for evaluation depends on the specific problem and can be accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other suitable metric¹.\n",
    "4. After evaluating all combinations, GridSearchCV identifies the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance according to the chosen metric.\n",
    "5. Finally, GridSearchCV returns the best combination of hyperparameters and optionally retrains the model on the entire dataset using these optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating the process of hyperparameter tuning, GridSearchCV helps save time and resources that would otherwise be spent manually searching for optimal hyperparameter values¹."

    "**GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** are both techniques used for **hyperparameter tuning** in machine learning models. The main difference between them lies in the way they explore the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **GridSearchCV**, you define a **grid** of hyperparameter values to search over. The algorithm then exhaustively evaluates the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. This means that GridSearchCV tries **all possible combinations** of hyperparameters, which can be computationally expensive when dealing with a large search space¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **RandomizedSearchCV** randomly samples a fixed number of combinations from the hyperparameter space. Instead of trying all possible combinations, it selects a subset of combinations to evaluate. This makes RandomizedSearchCV more suitable when there are **many hyperparameters** and the search space is large¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV depends on several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size of the search space**: If the search space is relatively small and you want to evaluate all possible combinations, GridSearchCV can be a good choice. However, if the search space is large and evaluating all combinations is computationally expensive, RandomizedSearchCV can provide a more efficient alternative¹².\n",
    "- **Available computational resources**: GridSearchCV requires more computational resources as it evaluates all combinations. If you have limited computational resources, RandomizedSearchCV can be a better option as it samples only a subset of combinations¹.\n",
    "- **Prior knowledge about hyperparameters**: If you have prior knowledge or intuition about which hyperparameters are likely to be more important or have a larger impact on the model's performance, you might prefer GridSearchCV to ensure that those hyperparameters are included in the search¹.\n",

It occurs when the model learns or knows something that it otherwise would not know, which can invalidate the estimated performance of the model¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem because it can result in models that perform well on the training dataset but **poorly on new, unseen data**. The goal of predictive modeling is to develop models that accurately predict outcomes on new data. Data leakage undermines this goal by allowing the model to learn patterns or relationships that are not present in real-world scenarios¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate data leakage: Let's say you are building a model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. During training, you accidentally include the transaction timestamp as a feature. The model learns that transactions made during certain times of the day are more likely to be fraudulent. However, this information is not available at prediction time because you won't know the transaction timestamp in advance. As a result, the model's performance will be overestimated during training and may not generalize well to new transactions¹.\n",
