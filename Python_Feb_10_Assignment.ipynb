The open() function takes two arguments: the name of the file and \\nthe mode in which the file should be opened.\\n\\nThere are several modes in which a file can be opened in Python:\\n\\n1. 'r' (Read Only): This mode opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\\n2. 'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file \\ndoes not exist, a new file is created.\\n3. 'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing, but the new data is appended to the end of the file. If the \\nfile does not exist, a new file is created.\\n4. 'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is used to create a new file, but only if the file does not already exist. If the \\nfile already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\\n5. 'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or a video. The b mode is usually combined \\nwith one of the other modes. For example, 'rb' is used to open a binary file in read-only mode, and 'wb' is used to open a \\nbinary file in write-only mode.\\n6. 't' (Text Mode): This mode is used to open a text file.
