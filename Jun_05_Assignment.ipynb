    "An activation function is a mathematical function used in artificial neural networks that decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. It does so by calculating the weighted sum of the inputs and adding a bias, and then comparing it to a threshold. The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron, which allows the network to learn complex patterns and perform nonlinear tasks. The activation function is used in the hidden layer as well as at the output layer of the network."

    "There are many types of activation functions that can be used in neural networks, depending on the problem and the desired output. Some of the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sigmoid**: This function takes any real value as input and outputs a value between 0 and 1. It is often used for binary classification problems, where the output represents the probability of belonging to a certain class. However, it has some drawbacks, such as being prone to vanishing gradients, saturating for large inputs, and not being zero-centered ².\n",
    "- **Tanh**: This function is similar to the sigmoid function, but it outputs a value between -1 and 1. It is also zero-centered, which makes it more suitable for hidden layers. However, it still suffers from vanishing gradients and saturation ².\n",
    "- **ReLU**: This function stands for rectified linear unit, and it outputs the input value if it is positive, and 0 otherwise. It is the most widely used activation function in neural networks, as it is simple, fast, and effective. It also helps to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, as it does not saturate for positive inputs. However, it has some drawbacks, such as being non-differentiable at 0, and dying out for negative inputs ²³.\n",
    "- **Leaky ReLU**: This function is a variation of the ReLU function, where it outputs a small positive value (usually 0.01) times the input value if it is negative, instead of 0. This helps to prevent the dying ReLU problem, where some neurons become inactive and stop learning. However, it still has the non-differentiability issue at 0 ².\n",
    "- **Softmax**: This function takes a vector of real values as input and outputs a vector of values between 0 and 1 that sum up to 1. It is often used for multi-class classification problems, where the output represents the probability distribution over the classes. It is also a generalization of the sigmoid function, where it can handle more than two classes ².\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the common types of activation functions used in neural networks, but there are many more, such as ELU, SELU, Swish, GELU, etc. Each activation function has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on the problem, the data, and the network architecture."

    "Activation functions are **non-linear transformations** that are applied to the outputs of artificial neurons in a neural network. They play an important role in the training process and performance of a neural network by shaping the output values, introducing non-linearity, and enabling gradient-based optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output values of a neural network depend on the choice of activation function. For example, some activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh, have a fixed range of output values, such as (0, 1) or (-1, 1), respectively. This can help to normalize the output values and prevent them from becoming too large or too small. Other activation functions, such as ReLU and ELU, have an unbounded range of output values, which can allow for more flexibility and expressiveness.\n",

    "The non-linearity of activation functions is essential for a neural network to learn complex and non-linear patterns from the data. Without activation functions, a neural network would be equivalent to a linear model, which can only learn linear relationships between the inputs and outputs. Activation functions introduce non-linearity by applying different transformations to different parts of the input space, such as saturating, clipping, or scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient-based optimization of a neural network relies on the activation functions to provide meaningful and non-zero gradients for backpropagation. The gradients of the activation functions determine how the weights and biases of the neural network are updated during the training process. Activation functions that have smooth and continuous gradients, such as sigmoid and tanh, can facilitate the gradient descent algorithm. However, they may also suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when the gradients become too small and slow down the learning process. Activation functions that have piecewise-linear or non-smooth gradients, such as ReLU and ELU, can avoid the vanishing gradient problem and speed up the learning process. However, they may also suffer from the dying ReLU problem, which occurs when some neurons become inactive and stop learning.\n",
